App Store Link: https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/hibernate/id1383595639

Hibernate is an iOS alarm clock app with options to play sleeping sounds to help the user fall asleep. It was my first Swift
app where my main goal was explore iOS development by creating a quick project. As a result, my design and code was not
very clean throughout this project as I had little experience with proper Swift/iOS conventions. However, I did learn a tremendous
amount and was able to publish the app as well.

Key Features:  
• Accurate wake up alarm at the scheduled time  
• Diverse range of alarm and sleeping sounds  
• In app purchase option to access more sounds

Skills Practiced:  
• Working with storyboard and autolayout

• Scheduling local notifications  
• StoreKit for making in-app purchases  
• Custom animation transitions  
• Basic UIKit elements such as UIImageView, UITableView, UIButton, and UILabel
